Purpose: for splitting up large UNSORTED CSV files based on a category.
		For instance, if working with a file containing data on an entire state
		you can run the data through this program and split it up based on county,
		assuming you know which column that information is stored.


Python version: 3.6


How to run: if you have python 3 installed, you should be able to simply double click
the file and the program prompts should initiate.

Run time: When run on 4.5 GB CSV, splitting into about 20 or so files, program execution took around 15-20 minutes.

Haven't cleaned it up yet, so it's not as condensed as could be, but it will certainly get the job done.
